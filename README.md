# Moldule 1 Challenge Homework Assignment

## Description

I received a work ticket assignment where we needed to update the html/css code to have semantic elements and make the website more accessible friendly. I changed certain div elements to be semantic elements that were more informative about the structure of the page. I also gave alt attributes to certain images and symbols so they might be describable by a screen reader in the event a user could not actually see them. I condensed down and re-ordered some of the css stylings so they followed a more logical order when compared to the html as well as eliminating excess stylings.
